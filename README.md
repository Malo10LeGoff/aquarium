# aquarium
C++ project for educational purposes.  
Aquarium software modelizing project.  
The goal of the project is to emphasize use of relevant **Design Patterns** in the software structure.  

---

## Software specifications 
We are simulating an aquarium ecosystem with this software. 
The ecosystem is composed of multiple pieces.
